## Overview

### The project

For this project, the objective is to allow the user to order one or more sofas. HTML, CSS and JS backend is given, I only had to write the JS front.

    -Display every product on the homepage --> get datas from the API.
    -Click on the product and redirect him on the product page.
    -Select colors and quantity of product and add it to the cart --> adding to localStorage.
    -On cart page, every product are display and there's total quantity and total price of the order.
    -User can still modify quantity or remove product on the cart page.
    -Clicking on the order button redirect the user to a confirmation page where a confirmation number is written.
